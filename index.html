       <p>NEW YORK, N.Y. (October 27, 1968) - Sterling Cooper & Partners 
           today foramlized the recent merger of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce and 
           Cutler Gleason Chaough with the release of a new logo and agency brand.
        <br/>
        <br/>
           The partners commented:
           <br/>
           "We are pleased to join with our new partners and present our new name and logo, 
           which reflect our shared efforts to provide quality service in the marketplace," 
           said SC&P partner Bert Cooper.
           <br/>
           <br/>
           "As far as logos go, this is front page news," said SC&P partner Roger Sterling. 
           "My publisher loves the name of our new firm, and so do I."
           <br/>
           <br/>
           “A name can mean a new beginning, a chance to see yourself as you would dream to be, and to leave the baggage you have accumulated over the years behind,” said SC&P partner Don Draper. “At least that’s been my observation.”
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <em>“The logo for the combined entity is clean, visually-striking, and you have to agree the ambersand is funky,” said SC&P partner Ted Chaough.</em>
           <br/>
           <br/>
           <h5>This is coded by Vic de Aranzeta. All of this writing and logo can originally be seen on Mad Men. </h5>
